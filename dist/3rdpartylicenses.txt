Silk companion icon set #1 - "More Silk!"

The FamFamFam Silk icon set is a very large,
consistent set of well-drawn icons that has
proven to be popular with both applications
and web sites.

On a number of occasions I have found myself
wanting more icons in the same style. This 
companion set represents what I needed but also
what I felt like adding.

Some are new icons in the same style, some are
alternative sizes/colours of the existing icons
and some are new compositions of the elements.

Any questions about this companion set please
contact damieng@gmail.com.
